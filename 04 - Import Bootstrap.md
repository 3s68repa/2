Import Bootstrap 
Importing Bootstrap into Webpack requires the loaders we installed in the first section. Weâ€™ve installed them with npm, but now Webpack needs to be configured to use them.

- Set up the loaders in webpack.config.js. Your configuration file is now complete and should match the snippet below. The only new part here is the module section.


> ### Look into code 3.html

Hereâ€™s a recap of why we need all these loaders. style-loader injects the CSS into a < style > element in the < head > of the HTML page, css-loader helps with using @import and url(), postcss-loader is required for Autoprefixer, and sass-loader allows us to use Sass.

- Now, letâ€™s import Bootstrapâ€™s CSS. Add the following to src/scss/styles.scss to import all of Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass.


> // Import all of Bootstrap's CSS
> @import "~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";

You can also import our stylesheets individually if you want. [Read the Sass import docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/customize/sass/#importing) for details.

- Next we load the CSS and import Bootstrapâ€™s JavaScript. Add the following to src/js/main.js to load the CSS and import all of Bootstrapâ€™s JS. Popper will be imported automatically through Bootstrap.


> // Import our custom CSS

> import '../scss/styles.scss'

> // Import all of Bootstrap's JS

> import * as bootstrap from 'bootstrap'

You can also import JavaScript plugins individually as needed to keep bundle sizes down:


> import Alert from 'bootstrap/js/dist/alert'

> // or, specify which plugins you need:

> import { Tooltip, Toast, Popover } from 'bootstrap'

[Read the JavaScript docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/javascript/) for more information on how to use Bootstrapâ€™s plugins.

- And youâ€™re done! ðŸŽ‰ With Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass and JS fully loaded, your local development server should now look like this.

Now you can start adding any Bootstrap components you want to use. Be sure to [check out the complete Webpack example project](https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/webpack) for how to include additional custom Sass and optimize your build by importing only the parts of Bootstrapâ€™s CSS and JS that you need.
